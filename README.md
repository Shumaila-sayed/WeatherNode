# Weather Node 🌦️

**Weather Node** is a JavaScript-powered weather app that fetches real-time weather data using the [Visual Crossing API](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api). This project allows users to search for any location and toggle the displayed temperature between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

## Key Features ✨

- 🌍 **Location-Based Weather Search**: Enter a city to get current weather data for that location.
- 🌡️ **Fahrenheit/Celsius Toggle**: Easily switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius for temperature readings.
- ⚡ **Asynchronous API Handling**: Uses Promises and async/await to handle API requests smoothly.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **JavaScript** (Async/Await, Promises)
- **HTML/CSS** for basic styling and layout
- **Visual Crossing API** for weather data

## How It Works 🔄

1. The user enters a location (city name) into a search form.
2. The app fetches the weather data from the Visual Crossing API.
3. It displays the temperature in the selected unit (Fahrenheit or Celsius).
4. The page updates based on the API response, showing relevant weather information.
